	<h3>July 5, 2018</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Last night I attended the free fireworks show in Jonesboro, AR <br>
	with my little brother, Caleb. The trip was last-minute and I had <br>
	never utilized the exposure settings on my camera before, so <br>
	I went full-blown amateur and videod the show, and these photos are <br>
	actually screenshots. I guess I didn't have to tell my visitors that, <br>
	but now you know my little secret ;)<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Next year I'm definitely planning to study up on exposure so I'm <br>
	looking forward to the improvement I'll see in next year's results. <br>
	</p>
	<h3>September 10th, 2018</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	This weekend I took photos of my sister's family, The Chessers, and <br>
	I did a couple's session for my bestfriend and her husband, Marie & Bobby. <br>
	I've been searching for people to let me do photos for my Gallery, <br>
	and it seems like everyone is always so busy! In the next few months <br>
	I hope to make time to take photos of some of my other family <br>
	members and a few of my coworkers.
